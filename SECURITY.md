# Security policy

Security is a top priority for Contao. Please help us make the system more
secure!

## Reporting a security issue

If you think that you have found a security issue in Contao, please send an
email to **security [at] contao.org**. Emails to this address will be forwarded
to a private channel of the Contao core team.

Never disclose any information about a vulnerability on the public web (blog
posts, tweets, GitHub issues, etc.) before the vulnerability has been
acknowledged and fixed in a new Contao version!

## Resolving process

For every report, we first attempt to confirm the vulnerability. When it is
confirmed, the core team works on a solution following these steps:

1. Send an acknowledgement to the reporter;
2. Work on a patch;
3. Obtain a CVE identifier from mitre.org;
4. Publish a security announcement on contao.org;
5. Send the patch to the reporter for review;
6. Apply the patch to all maintained versions of Contao;
7. Release new versions for all affected versions;
8. Announce the new versions and the vulnerability on contao.org;

## Bug bounty

Contao is an open-source project where most of the work is done by volunteers.
We appreciate that developers are trying to find security issues in Contao and
report them responsibly, but we are currently unable to pay bug bounties.
